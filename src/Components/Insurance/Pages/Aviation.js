      <h4>Marine Hull Insurance</h4>
      <p>
        This policy provides cover against physical damage as well as attendant
        liabilities to ships/boats/yachts and other vessels. It is available for
        sea going vessels mainly for leisure, pleasure or domestic use and it
        protects against damage, loss or theft of the boat while at use or
        leisure. The sum insured is the market value of the hull to either
        repair or replace in the event of total loss. Cover may also extend to
        include the engine, contents on the boat, and against legal liabilities
        in view of ownership or operations.
