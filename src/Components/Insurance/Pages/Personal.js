        <p>
          Life assurance is a way to help protect your loved ones financially in
          event of your demise during the length of your policy. Your family has
          the reassurance of knowing that if you died while covered by the
          policy they could receive a cash sum payout which they could use to
          help with household bills, child-care costs or covering mortgage
          payments. It therefore ensures that you have peace of mind in knowing
          that your loved ones will not be financially burdened when you are
          gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone who has dependents should consider taking out life insurance.
          Dependents may be a partner, children or someone who relies on you for
          help or income because in the event of your disability or demise, the
          dependents may struggle to pay bills or cover their living costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have debts or a mortgage, a Life insurance policy could pay out
          cash if you die during the policy term and this could be used to help
          pay off these debts or it could help your family with everyday living
          expenses or child care costs. Life assurance payouts could also help
          cover funeral expenses too.

          Owning a home has become a reality for many people in Kenya today.
          However, taking out a mortgage does not always mean a smooth ride in
          the journey towards becoming the proud homeowner you have always
          dreamt of. The upheavals in the industry can result in your loss of
          the home and you may be unable to maintain the mortgage payments.

          home. Should you pass away while the mortgage is not fully paid, your
          loved ones will never be homeless Get a quote

        <p>
          Retirement is one of those inevitable phases of life, which marks the
          end of our careers that we have built over the years by acquiring
          skills and constant hard work. Assignments, deadlines, meetings etc.
          soon get replaced by holidays, pursuing new hobbies, and spending more
          time with family. While some people look forward to this relaxed and
          stress-free life post retirement, some get worried about the loss of a
          steady source of income. If you do not prepare financially for this
          phase in your life, it can be quite depressing for you and your
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          A retirement plan will help you prepare for life after paid work ends,
          not just financially but in all aspects of life. The non-financial
          aspects include lifestyle choices such as how to spend time in
          retirement, where to live, when to completely quit working, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Retirement planning changes throughout different life stages. Early in
          a person's working life, retirement planning is about setting aside
          enough money for retirement. During the middle of your career, it
          might also include setting specific income or asset targets and taking
          the steps to achieve them. At retirement, one enters the distribution
          phase where you are no longer paying but you are getting back decades
          of saving.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to retirement planning is to evaluate your retirement needs,
          set a financial goal, start early, stick to the plan, and go for
          products that will help you achieve your targeted goal as well as
          protect your money from the volatility of the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advantages of saving in a registered retirement benefit scheme is that
          you have a tax exempt limit which means you increase your income and
          the investment return earned is also tax exempt hence generating more
          funds for reinvestment. Being a registered member to a retirement
          scheme allows you to assign 60% of your pension fund as a guarantee
          against a mortgage.

          with a spouse. If the annuity is shared with a spouse, it reverts to
          the surviving spouse in case one death of the other spouse.
