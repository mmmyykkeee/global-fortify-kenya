      The agricultural sector continues to be a contributor of the Gross
      Domestic Product (GDP) for Kenya. Being a backbone of our economy, it is
      therefore important to manage risks well to sustain and improve the
      contribution it has. Insuring agriculture means that a farmer’s investment
      is not lost should any insured event occur and it therefore secures a
      farmer’s income through the compensation.

        radio signal (RFID) which will be inserted into the body of the animal.
        This device which has a unique number to identify the animal may be
        inserted into the animal’s stomach or a microchip into its body.
