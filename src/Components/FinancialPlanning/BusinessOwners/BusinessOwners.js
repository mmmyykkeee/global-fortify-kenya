            Successful small and medium business owners are motivated, they
            think differently and have taken risks in anticipation for a payoff.
            As a business owner, you constantly have to make important decisions
            for your business including, how to grow your business, having the
            right people, processes and structures in place and having a
            profitable business. In business, similar to our individual lives,
            there is need to think way into the future and plan accordingly
            because we cannot predict the future. Having a financial plan in
            place provides you with a safety net to cushion you and at the same
            time positions your business for growth and success in the long run.
